About me:
These are words that describe me.  They don't really, but that's because I don't want you to know too much about me, what with identity theft and all.
On the other hand, I'm supposed to be vulnerable.  It's how we get to know and like people.  It's how we make friends and fall in love.
If we were talking in person, I guess it would be easier for me to trust you.
